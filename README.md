### Hello, I'm Wei Ching :blush:	

A highly motivated individual, who self-learnt machine learning, and is currently pursuing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) internship. Coming from a Social Science background, I aspire to be an AI Engineer who builds impactful and scalable solutions for global problems. Two causes that I fervently believe in are poverty :rocket: and women empowerment :woman:.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on deployment of ML models - learning Scala and other data engineering concepts
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Pytorch - started my Deep Learning journey with Keras and learning a new framework now
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects for social good - for instance Driven Data's [Genetic Engineering Attribution Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/63/genetic-engineering-attribution/)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with deepening my programming skills - picking up some computer science fundamentals now (C++)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ANYTHING! :satisfied:
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: drop me an [email](mailto:wcong.2017@socsc.smu.edu.sg)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: :running:
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a Politics, Law and Economics major student
